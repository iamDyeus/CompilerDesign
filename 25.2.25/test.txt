In a break from its European allies, the United States aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a resolution condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.
The move, under newly elected US President Donald Trump, has strained US-Europe ties and raised doubts about Washington’s shifting stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.
The UN general assembly vote saw the US and Russia opposing a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that directly accused Moscow of aggression and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The resolution was passed with 93 votes in favour, 18 against, and 65 abstentions.
